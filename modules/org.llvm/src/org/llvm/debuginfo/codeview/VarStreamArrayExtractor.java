/// VarStreamArrayExtractor is intended to be specialized to provide customized

/// beginning of the next record, but where the length of the record is not yet
/// known.  Upon completion, it should return an appropriate Error instance if
/// a record could not be extracted, or if one could be extracted it should
/// return success and set Len to the number of bytes this record occupied in
/// the underlying stream, and it should fill out the fields of the value type
/// Item appropriately to represent the current record.
///
/// You can specialize this template for your own custom value types to avoid
/// having to specify a second template argument to VarStreamArray (documented
