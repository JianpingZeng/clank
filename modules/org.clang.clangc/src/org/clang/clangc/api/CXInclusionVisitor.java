  *
  * This visitor function will be invoked by clang_getInclusions() for each
  * file included (either at the top-level or by \#include directives) within
  * a translation unit.  The first argument is the file being included, and
  * the second and third arguments provide the inclusion stack.  The
  * array is sorted in order of immediate inclusion.  For example,
  * the first element refers to the location that included 'included_file'.
