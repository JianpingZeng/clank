/// \brief This union template exposes a suitably aligned and sized character
/// array member which can hold elements of any of up to four types.
///
/// These types may be arrays, structs, or any other types. The goal is to
/// expose a char array buffer member which can be used as suitable storage for
/// a placement new of any of these types. Support for more than seven types can
/// be added at the cost of more boiler plate.
